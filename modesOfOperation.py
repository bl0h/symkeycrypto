# In this task, you will explore the differences in
# security attained by the ECB and CBC modes of encryption. Using the AES-128
# primitive provided by your cryptographic library, implement your own versions of
# ECB and CBC modes of encryption (do not use the built-in methods for modes of
# operation). Your program should take a (plaintext) file, generate a random key (and
# random IV, in the case of CBC), and write the encryption of the plaintext in a new
# file.
